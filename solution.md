# Solutions

There are a few bugs:

1. `tuple` is immutable and it does not have the method `append()`. Therefore, the container `x` should not be a `tuple`. This means that we need to change the line `x = ()`. Also, note that the variable name `x` is not descriptive.
2. The `range(1000)` provides integers `0`, `1`, ..., `999`. Therefore, we should use `range(1, 1001)` instead as we want to have the integers `1`, ..., `1000`.
3. The indentation of the `if` body is not correct.
4. The logic of the `if` statement is not correct - `or` should be used instead of `and`. Also, in Python, we should use `and` and `or` instead of `&` and `|`.
5. Instead of `is_divisible_by_k(x, 7)`, it should be `is_divisible_by_k(i, 7)`. It is because `x` is a container, not an integer
6. `assert` statement should not be used here - `assert` should be used to detect problems early in your program. Here we want to return a boolean value so that we can tell if `x` is divisible by `k` or not. Therefore, using `assert` statement is not appropriate.
